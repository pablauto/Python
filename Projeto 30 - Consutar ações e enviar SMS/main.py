# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

    ## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/ 
    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME. 

#6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.

    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 

#8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.
